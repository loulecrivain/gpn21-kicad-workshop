This handout is intended to be used in conjunction with an instructor giving a KiCad workshop.
It is based on cpresser's MCH2022 handout and should be valid for KiCad version 7.
This repo contains the source .odt file which embeds the D-DIN font it uses.
Plus a link:./handout.pdf[.pdf] and link:./handout.png[.png] render of that.
And the KiCad source for the example schematic.
